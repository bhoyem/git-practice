            <h4>Confusion is normal and good!</h4>
            <p>The first phase of learning anything new is discovering what you don't know so if you feel confusion when
                you're taking on a new learning endeavor, it's a good sign that you're expanding your awareness about
                things that previously, you didn't even know were out there.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Perseverance is key.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>Through repetition and by using the skills or commands you're learning, the function and application
                will, over time, reveal itself more clearly until one time you'll get that satisfying feeling when it
                suddenly "clicks" and you truly understand exactly what is happening and why. Don't give up! History is
                filled with experts who were anything but until that last puzzle piece of their journey fell into place.
